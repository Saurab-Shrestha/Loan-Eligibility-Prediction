## Loan Approval Prediction Machine Learning

### Introduction
In this notebook, we are going to predict whether a person is eligible for loan or not. The dataset is from Loan Approval Prediction Hackathon hosted by Analytics Vidhya.

### Problem Statement
Dream Housing Finance company deals in all kinds of home loans. They have a presence across all urban, semi-urban and rural areas. The customer first applies for a home loan and after that, the company validates the customer eligiblity for the loan.

The company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real-time) based on customer detail provided while filling out online application forms. These detials are Gender, Martial status, Education, number of dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit history, and others.

This is a Binary Classification problem in which we need to predict our Target label which is `Loan Status`.

Loan status can have two values: Yes or No.

Yes: if the loan is approved

No: if the loan is disapproved

So using the training dataset we will train our model and try to predict our target column that is `Loan Status` on the test dataset.
